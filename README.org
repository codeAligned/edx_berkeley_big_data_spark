* Manager Virtual Development Enviroment with Vagrant and emacs

  [[https://www.vagrantup.com/][Vagrant]] is software to help you to manage vritual enviroments. It
  becomes easy to configure, reproducible and portable work
  enviroments.

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] is powerful editor that provides modes to manager vagrants
  virtua machines, access files and folder remotely transparently. So
  a piece of cake to develop and work with vagrant. For this project
  we worked with 2 mode: [[https://github.com/dougm/vagrant-tramp][vagrant-tramp]]and and [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Sunrise_Commander][sunrise]] (see also:
  [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/double-dired-with-sunrise-commander/][pragmatic_emacs]])

  The snapshot bellow shows a printscreen of the sunrise fle manager
  in emacs:
