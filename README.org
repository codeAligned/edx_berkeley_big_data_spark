* EDX: Big Data Analysis with Spark (Berkeley)
  
  https://www.edx.org/course/big-data-analysis-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs110x

  This project is course that I took in the EDX platform (The course
  was archived)

  * Learn objectives
    * How to use [[http://spark.apache.org/][Apache Spark]] to perform data analysis
    * First step with machine learn library [[http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html][MLlib]]
    * How to use parallel programming to explore data sets
    * Apply log mining, textual entity recognition and collaborative
      filtering techniques to real-world data questions
    * Start learn about recomendation system (movie recomendation)
    * Use emacs, tramp and sunrise to mage and edit remote file
    * Get more familiar with vagrant (Manager virtual development
      enviroments)
      
  See [[file:mooc-setup-master/README.md]] 

* Spark notes
  
  Spark is a general purpose cluster computing framework that provides
  efficient in-memory computations for large data sets by distributing
  computation across multiple computers.

  * Workflow
    * Create or load a RDD (Resilient Distributed Data)
    * Invoke operation on RDD by passing fucntion closures to each
      element
      * When Spark runs a closure on a worker, any variables used in
        the closure are copied to that node, but are maintained within
        the local scope of that closure.
      * Shared variables: /Broadcast variables/ (read only) is
        distrubited to all cluster
    * Use the result RDD with actions: count, collect ( the result is
      not big) and save
  * Tips
    * Try to think as much as possible in term of Key value pairs
    * Do not copy all elements of large RDD to the driver (Avoid
      collect() in big data) because of the memory limit
      * Use take oy takeSample
      * Or Use filter
    * avoid GroupByKey() when is possible (shuffle data, so there is a
      lot of data traffic and that have cost)

* Manager Virtual Development Enviroment with Vagrant and emacs

  [[https://www.vagrantup.com/][Vagrant]] is software to help you to manage vritual enviroments. It
  becomes easy to configure, reproducible and portable work
  enviroments.

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] is powerful editor that provides modes to manager vagrants
  virtual machines, access files and folder remotely transparently. So
  a piece of cake to develop and work with vagrant. For this project
  we worked with 2 mode: [[https://github.com/dougm/vagrant-tramp][vagrant-tramp]]and and [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Sunrise_Commander][sunrise]] (see also:
  [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/double-dired-with-sunrise-commander/][pragmatic_emacs]])

  The snapshot bellow shows a printscreen of the sunrise file manager
  in emacs:
